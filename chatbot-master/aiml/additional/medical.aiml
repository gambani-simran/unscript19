<category><pattern>i’ve had this off balance/unsteady feeling in my head doctors are clueless?</pattern><template>this is commonly occuring with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (bppv) is caused by a problem in the inner ear. tiny calcium “stones” inside your inner ear canals help you keep your balance. normally when you move a certain way such as when you stand up or turn your head these stones move around. but things like infection or inflammation can stop the stones from moving as they should. this sends a false message to your brain and causes the vertigo. i̇t can be treated by positioning exercises at a professional physotehra post or neurologist. regards</template></category>

<category><pattern>my 65 year old father needs gallbladder surgery we need a second opinion?</pattern><template>hi asthma as such has nothing to do with the gall stones. the doctors may be finding it risky to operate on him due to anesthesia and surgical risks involved as this surgery is a major surgery. if the gall bladder symptoms are bearable and not much then you can postpone the surgery. but once gall stones are formed its difficult to cure it only by medicines. surgery is the only option. if the gall stone symptoms are more he has to get operated with all the risks involved. endocopically done surgeries carry lesser risk. thanks</template></category>

<category><pattern>had gallbladder surgery – feel i still have it – surgeon says encountered problems…</pattern><template>hi filling defect on a cholangiogram is definitely abnormal and it indicates that there was a obstruction in the path of bile duct. you should have been informed about this for sure. i dont see any reason why they must have hidden this fact from you. at present the obstruction or the sphincter of oddi. per se wont cause you any symptoms. i personally feel that there might be some remnant remaining inside or a adhesion not removed. other possibility is any intra operative trauma to the surrounding structures will cause such pain as this is quite common in such complicated cases. thanks</template></category>
